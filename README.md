# carriersettings-extractor

## Introduction

This project is designed to automate the processing of protobufs shipped on Google Pixel
devices which are used by the proprietary CarrierSettings app and are generated by the
open source https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/carrier_settings/ project.

2 XMLs are generated, an APN XML and a CarrierConfig XML, which can be used within the AOSP
project.

This is a continuation of the https://github.com/daradib/carriersettings-extractor project.

## Build

```m carriersettings_extractor```


## Standalone usage

```out/host/linux-x86/bin/carriersettings_extractor vendor/google_devices/<codename>/proprietary/product/etc/CarrierSettings/ /root/dir/of/aosp/tree/ /output/path/of/apns-conf.xml /output/path/of/carrierconfig-vendor.xml <codename>```

For example, on the Pixel 6 (oriole) whilst in the root of the AOSP tree, you would run the below to produce apns-conf.xml and carrierconfig-vendor.xml in the root of your AOSP tree.

```out/host/linux-x86/bin/carriersettings_extractor vendor/google_devices/oriole/proprietary/product/etc/CarrierSettings/ . apns-conf.xml carrierconfig-vendor.xml oriole```

## Inline usage

Add the below to the device.mk of a new Pixel device

```
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \
    extracted-carrierconfig \
    extracted-apns
```
