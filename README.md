# carriersettings-extractor

## Introduction

This project is designed to automate the processing of protobufs shipped on Google Pixel
devices which are used by the proprietary CarrierSettings app and are generated by the
open source https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/carrier_settings/ project.

2 XMLs are generated, an APN XML and a CarrierConfig XML, which can be used within the AOSP
project.

This is a continuation of the https://github.com/daradib/carriersettings-extractor project.
